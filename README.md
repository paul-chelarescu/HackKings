# SMS Snake
Has there been any time you wanted to play a game of snake against another player? How about using SMS to send the commands, instead of the old "down", "up", etc.? Well, now there is a way to do this! 

An adapted javascript snake game to work with two players that takes its commands through the Twilio API, the one that receives the SMS. Extra difficulty is added in the game through the fact that it takes up to a few seconds for your command to be received by the snake, so hindsight is required!
